## Twilio and AI
The traditional fetch from API / DB is so boring, and redundant.
How about leveraging our AI, to pickup the scent of our mood, and automatically suggest places around us for the best feel.

Not to mention, our awesome Twilio's SMS integration, allowing a free flow of SMS to the consumers, for instant directions and sending other links.

## Additional Prize Categories

Yes, our submission qualifies for 
 - "Impactful Innovators" and 
 - "Entertaining Endeavors"

The reason for "Impactful Innovators" being : 
A lot of foreigners or ourselves when we visit a new place, or a city end up getting unplanned for the day, most of the time.
Our application, gets just your mood as an input via a web interface, and suggests you the best spots/places, to feel your best.

This is a must use application, for all those unplanned travellers, to explore a lot on every new place they travel to.

The reason for "Entertaining Endeavors" being :
Not only it does cover the  spots like, temples, forts, etc.,
But also it can take in your mood to give you good pubs, drink bars, and fun activity malls, which gives you the real fun of new places.
